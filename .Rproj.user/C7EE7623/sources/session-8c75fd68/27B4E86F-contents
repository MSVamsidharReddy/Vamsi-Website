########### Example 1 ##################

#Write functions to evaluate following mathematical formulas
#a) y = 5e^(-x)
#b) z = sqrt(x^2+y^2)

######## Example 2 #####################

# a) Read in the "Cereal" dataset, look at the first few rows with head and 
#inspect the data types of the variables in the dataframe with str 
 



# b) Add a new variable to the dataset called ’totalcarb’, 
#which is the sum of ’carbo’ and ’sugars'



# c) How many cereals in the dataframe are ’hot’ cereals? 



# d) How many unique suppliers are included in the dataset?




# e) Take a subset of the dataframe with only the
# supplier ’K’ (Kellogg’s)





# f) Take a subset of the dataframe of all cereals that
#have less than 80 calories, 
#AND have more than 20 units of vitamins.



# g) Take a subset of the dataframe containing cereals that 
#contain at least 1 unit of sugar, 
#and keep only the variables ’Cereal.name’, 
#’calories’ and ’vitamins’. 
#Then inspect the first few rows of the dataframe with head.



# h) For one the above subset, write to a new CSV file



# i) Rename the column ’Supplier’ to ’Producer’


# j)  change hot.or cold into a factor variable
